# TopDownRPG
This is top down 2D RPG project made in Unity.
Its based on the old Zelda games that I used to play.
This project is a work in progress and so may not resemble the final product.

**To view this project you can either:**
- Download and build this repository using Unity (built and tested on **Unity 2018.4.19f1**)
- Go to my github pages site and play the WebGL version at (https://maxstewart.github.io/assets/unity/RPG/)
